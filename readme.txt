This plugin adds the VenoBox Responsive Lightbox to links to display Vimeo and YouTube videos, images, iframe or inline content in a lightbox display.


== Description ==

This plugin adds the VenoBox Responsive Lightbox to links, displaying videos; YouTube, Vimeo, images, iframe, Google Maps or other inline content in a responsive lightbox display.

The big difference compared to many others plugins like this is that VenoBox calculates the max width of the image displayed and preserves its height if is taller than the window (so in small devices you can scroll down the content, avoiding vertical microscopic resized images).


== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin:

1. Upload the `venobox-lightbox` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Options are in Settings => Venobox Lightbox
